The Morse potential has a local max at r ~ 5.6, and it decreases rapidly as we approach
r=0 and decreases slowly as we approach r=inf. The birds stay circling for around 20 seconds, then
spiral out away from each other indefinitely at evenly spaced angles.
Why does this happen? The birds first tend to a ring pattern with constant angular movement with a radius
greater than 5.6, so when they get beyond this radius, it becomes better to go away from each other.
Thus there is a bifurcation between going in and going out.
Also, the error = 10e-2 approximation has a completely different conclusion here, because the situation is
so touchy. But with only a half-second more calculation, we converge to the correct behavior with the adaptive solver.

C_R = 7.4*20, C_a = 3.8*20, ell_r = 0.7, ell_a = 4.9

example_mill.png:

C_R = 7.4*20, C_a = 3.8*20, ell_r = 0.7, ell_a = 4.9 (same as morse_potential_mill), and starting positions are
arranged to be evenly spaced on a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, with tangential velocities to the circle.
Step size is 0.01, so expected error is (0.01)^5 and (0.01)^4

We see it divide into strata with rings separated from each other by a distance of min(U)

N=7, parameters are the same as in the other mill examples. The Rk4 and RK5 approximation disagree so much that the
error is over 500 after 30 seconds (it's 506.2227944159231) but if we zoom in, the qualitative behavior of the
flocks actually agrees in both cases -- they align velocities and remain at around 2 units away from each other,
which maximimizes morse potential for the parameters.
